# hackaustin/prompter

- a thing to submit prompts for [hack austin](https://hackaustin.net), built with svelte and prisma

- if you really wanted, you could use it for your hackathon, but it i made it in like 2 days and it was very fun (read: scuffed) to use at the event

### running
- im not sure honestly, i think i just used `vercel dev` or `npm run dev` and it generally worked 

### contact
- say hi at `suhas@hackaustin.net` if you have any questions or want to make fun of my code
